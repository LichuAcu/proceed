# PROCEED: Performance Routing Optimization for Cost-Efficient and Effective Deployment

## CS 224N Final Project by Lichu Acu√±a and Odin Farkas

This is an open-source routing algorithm for large language models, selecting the appropriate language model to query given a prompt, seeking a balance between performance and cost.

We train and evaluate our models with the [RouterBench](https://github.com/withmartian/routerbench) dataset.

This repository includes our explorations on what architecture to use for the router. Currently, it has two basic implementations using [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) and [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert).
